## Aluminium composite panels

Aluminium composite panels are flat panels that are made from aluminium composite material. These flat panels are made from two thin coil-coated aluminium sheets bonded to a non-aluminium core. Their high quality and lightweight cladding makes them versatile to style and gives them a broad range of design options.  Being light in weight, aluminium composite panels offer the robustness of heavy sheet metal at a much lowest cost.


### Benefits Of Aluminium Composite Panels

- **Quality & Durability** – <p style="padding-right: 20px">Made with high quality metals and plastics, aluminium composite panels offer decisive quality and durability against harsh weather impacts. Their unique fabrication method enables them to act as a barrier and reduce the outside noise penetration.</p>
- **Cost Effective** – <p style="padding-right: 20px">aluminium composite panels reduce the burden on pocket. They not only possess lowest initial cost while being manufactured but also reduce the costs of artificial energy at later stages.</p>

- **Fire Safe** – <p style="padding-right: 20px">ACPs are labelled as fire proof as they are highly resistant to domestic fires. However, they can melt over a temperature of 650° but they don’t omit any kind of gases, thus doesn’t present any harm to inhabitants.</p>
- **Installation & Maintenance-** – <p style="padding-right: 20px">aluminium composite panels are easy to install and offer hassle-free maintenance. The dust found on these panels can easily be wiped off with a clean fabric.</p>
